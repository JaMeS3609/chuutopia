                    <p>
                        Except as represented in this agreement, all work produced by us is
                        provided "as is". We make no warranties, expressed or implied, and
                        hereby disclaim and negate all other warranties, including without
                        limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness
                        for a purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other
                        violation of rights. Furthermore, we don't warrant or make any
                        representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability
                        of the content provided by our bot.

                    <p>
                        In no event shall we or our suppliers be liable for any damages
                        (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or
                        due to business interruption,) arising out of the use or inability to
                        use the materials in the bot, even if we have been notified orally or in
                        writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do
                        not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability
                        for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply
                        to you.

                        to your use of the bot. Although we perform regular routine backups of

                        right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver
                        of such right or provision. These Terms of Use operate to the fullest
                        extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and
                        obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable
                        for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause
                        beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision
                        of these Terms of Use is determined to be unlawful, void, or
                        unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed
                        severable from these Terms of Use and does not affect the validity and
                        enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture,
                        partnership, employment or agency relationship created between you and
                        us as a result of these Terms of Use or use of the bot. You agree that
                        these Terms of Use will not be construed against us by virtue of having
                        drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based
                        on the electronic form of these Terms of Use and the lack of signing by
                        the parties hereto to execute these Terms of Use.
